In this workshop you will implement security controls for Amazon ECR repositories. This workshop takes a deep dive into user, network, and endpoint access controls for ECR repositories.

You will use [AWS IAM policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html), [Amazon ECR Private Repository Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/repository-policies.html) [Amazon VPC Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoints.html), [Amazon ECR VPC Endpoint Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoints.html#ecr-vpc-endpoint-policy), and [Amazon ECR lifecycle policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/LifecyclePolicies.html) in the labs.
