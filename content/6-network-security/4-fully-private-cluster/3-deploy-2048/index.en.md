Deploy the game 2048 as a sample application to verify that the AWS Load Balancer Controller creates an AWS ALB as a result of the ingress object. Complete the steps for the type of subnet you're deploying to.

Download the manifest.


```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-load-balancer-controller/v2.5.4/docs/examples/2048/2048_full.yaml
```

Since your nodes don't have access to the Amazon ECR Public image repository, then you need to pull the following container image and push it to a repository that your nodes have access to.

```bash
aws ecr create-repository --region $AWS_REGION --repository-name docker-2048
```


Please notice the "repositoryUri" from the output. It would look like the following

<<ACCOUNT_ID>>.dkr.ecr.<<REGION_CODE>>.amazonaws.com/docker-2048

Pull image from Public registry


```bash
docker pull public.ecr.aws/l6m2t8p7/docker-2048:latest
```


::::expand{header="Check Output"}

```bash
latest: Pulling from l6m2t8p7/docker-2048

```

::::

Get the image id for the pulled image

```bash
IMAGE_ID=$(docker image ls public.ecr.aws/l6m2t8p7/docker-2048:latest -q)
echo $IMAGE_ID
```


::::expand{header="Check Output"}

```bash
eb0a3a80a5dd
```
::::

Tag the image that you pulled with your registry, repository, and tag. Use the IMAGE_ID variable as image id from the previous command

```bash
docker tag $IMAGE_ID $ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_REGION.amazonaws.com/docker-2048
```


Authenticate to your Private ECR registry.

```bash
aws ecr get-login-password —-region $AWS_REGION | sudo docker login —-username AWS --password-stdin $ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_REGION.amazonaws.com
```

Push the image to the Private ECR repository

```bash
docker push $ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_REGION.amazonaws.com/docker-2048
```

- The following commands would edit the file and find/replace the line that says alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/scheme: internet-facing.
- It would also change the public image repository url to the private image repository url
- Apply the manifest to your cluster.

```bash
sed -i 's/internet-facing/internal/' 2048_full.yaml
sed -i 's/public.ecr.aws\/l6m2t8p7/$ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_REGION.amazonaws.com/' 2048_full.yaml
```

```bash
kubectl apply -f 2048_full.yaml
```

```bash
kubectl get ingress/ingress-2048 -n game-2048
```

An example output is as follows.

:::code{showCopyAction=false showLineNumbers=false}

Since we have created the load balancer in a private subnet, the value under ADDRESS in the previous output is prefaced with internal-.
