Protecting the infrastructure (hosts) is equally important as securing container images. Once an attacker is on the host, they can gain access to sensitive information, move laterally within the EKS cluster or within your AWS account. This section of the workshop explores different ways to mitigate risks from attacks launched directly against the host.

For more details on various Amazon EKS Best Practices in Infrastructure Security, refer to the [documentation](https://aws.github.io/aws-eks-best-practices/security/docs/hosts/).
